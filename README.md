# Deep_learning_project
<p>In this group project, we will take a look at the two deep learning models for image classifications. One is achieved by cnn model and the other is achived by hugging face.</p>
<br>
<p>For cnn model, which is prepared by Flora Wong. The accuracy score will be given.</p>
<br>
<p>For huggingface, which is prepared by Kun Bi, the model will be used to make predictions on given images. </p>
